# vibe-zone-project
 An HTML and JS website designed to be a holodeck for the internet

# General Functions
1. Users will be able to select a "vibe" by clicking a left-hand-side menu associated with it.
2. The "vibes" will be a full-screen (animated?) wallpaper of a relaxing scene, with a music playlist associated with it.
3. It should be a dynamic website, with it being accessible on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Everyone should be able to vibe.

# Content
I will need to secure the following pieces of content in order to make this project:

1. Animated backgrounds reperesenting each vibe
2. Mulit-hour long audio tracks to play during each vibe.
3. Icons for each vibe.
4. Written titles and descriptions of each vibe.
5. A help me section for telling people how this works.

# Code
Since I want this accessible on the internet, HTML and JS will have to work. I could probably combine the popout menu code and the zodiac code from my JS Class to help create the new stuff.
